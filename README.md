# hello-world
My first repository

Ceci here! I've decided to learn coding on my own, with the goal of applying to the Computer Science program in my college. In the past, I've worked as a graphic designer for 3 years in very interesting industries (packaging and fashion), but want to gain skills in web development and programming. 
Wish me luck!
